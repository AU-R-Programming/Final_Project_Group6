# FinalProjectGroup6

Before running our linear regression model, it is necessary to initialize the two input variables:
  `x`: matrix with number of rows representing the number of response (explanatory) variable
  `y`: vector representing the predictions
  
```{r}
x <- matrix(rnorm(400), ncol = 4)
y <- rnorm(100)
```

The next step is to run the model by calling the `our_lm` function.

```{r}
model <- our_lm(y, x, alpha = 0.05)
model
```

The individual results returned from the model can be obtained by running a command similar to below.

```{r}
# F-statistic
model$f_stat
```

Plots for the residuals can also be generated.

```{r}
# residuals vs fitted-values
res_plot(model$res, model$preds)

# qq-plot
qq_plot(model$res)

# histogram
histogram(model$res)
```
